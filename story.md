#Cinderella Story

A long, long time ago, in a small kingdom far, far away, there lived a girl named Ella. 

Ella's widowed father (whose name was Maury - but that's not important) remarried a woman with two daughters of her own.

Ella died six months after her father remarried, in a bizarre gardening accident. The authorities said best leave it ... unsolved. (Ella's mother, by the way, had spontaneously combusted in a flash of green light several years earlier).

Her father, being a wealthy though mad scientist (he made his fortune not through his mad scientistry but through shrewd land speculation), decided to save Ella. He conducted an experiment on Ella's body in an attempt to resurrect her. The experiment was partially successful - Ella did come back to life. Or, rather, half-life as she came back as a zombie. 

Oh, and like you've never made a mistake?

Ella's first act on being reanimated was to eat her father. Sure, she felt bad and all - one doesn't simply eat your family members, after all. This led to a chilling in the relationship between Ella and her stepmother, and what seems the likely origins of the whole ["evil stepmother" thing](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/casey-kasem-sad-strange-family-678902). 

The "evil stepmother" (whose name  was Tina, but that's not important) was frankly creeped out by this half-dead stepdaughter, and began to treat her badly. Ella's skin was a pasty white - you know, due to her zombie status - and she would rub cinders into her skin to darken it. This lead to the family disdainfully calling her "Cinderella". Get it? Cinder - Ella? 

Cinderella's home life goes from bad to worse.

Meanwhile, the King is trying to get his son married. Son isn't interested, really. King throws a party, for his son. The Prince says he's going to party like it's 1999!

Cinderella can go to the party if she finishes her chores. Mice and birds make a dress for her (it's complicated).

Her stepsisters wreck her dress. Cinderella cries. (Oh, and you wouldn't?)

Her Fairy Godmother shows up (And I'm all like, "where have you been the last few year?!") and (this part is too weird for detail) uses her magic wand to the turn - amongst other things - a pumpkin into a coach and mice into horses (early GMO experimentation FTW!). Oh, and she fixes the dress and makes glass slippers (top that, Lady Gaga).

Small catch - this magic power wears off at midnight. (It can happen). 

No problem. Cinderella goes to the ball and the Prince thinks she's pretty awesome. Everything you were thinking about the Prince up to this point is wrong. Maybe.

Dang it! Midnight. Cinderella flees. Loses a glass slipper (that somehow doesn't shatter). Chaos. 

(Spoiler alert): pumpkin doesn't make it; hope you hadn't grown attached. Horse-mice are okay - and somehow we're fine with that. Flippin' GMOs, man.

The King then orders up a medieval version of a police line-up to find the girl who dropped the slipper. This dude is really focussed on getting his son married.

Slapstick. Filler.

*Now* the shoe shatters! Typical.

No problem - Cinderella has the other slipper - and it doesn't fit! 

JK - it fits.

Cinderella, Prince, Happily Ever After. 

Epilogue: Prince become King. Obsesses about son not something something.
