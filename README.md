Cinderella Story II
====================

##An experiment in collaborative writing.

As part of the [Next Policy Challenge](http://nextpolicychallenge.github.io/), we're launching an early-stage experiment to both illustrate (for new users) how to do document collaboration on GitHub, and observe (for project design purposes) how collaborative writing happens in practice. 

###First Time on GitHub? Don't Know Where to Start?

First thing is to [Sign Up for GitHub](https://github.com/join).

After you have a GitHub account you can [go straight to the story and start editing](https://github.com/NextPolicyChallenge/cinderella-story/edit/master/story.md#fullscreen_blob_contents). Don't worry - you won't break anything (probably). When you're done, you'll see a little square in the top right hand corner - click on it and you should probably be able to figure your way along from there.

But if you want to learn a bit about GitHub first, try our [beginner tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZZqDhD-Ax4rmfma6Hi26RTREB-ApKZHzht5TBzWdjY/edit).


##Help Write the Next Version of Cinderella
If you already know your way around GitHub, then help us out.

We're using a high-level plot summary of the basic Cinderella story for people to collaborate on. You'll find the evolving story in [story.md](https://github.com/NextPolicyChallenge/cinderella-story/blob/master/story.md). Check out the [forks](https://github.com/NextPolicyChallenge/cinderella-story/network) that are developing too to see other takes that have built on this.

##Contributing 

*Fork, update, send a pull request* to see where we can take this. Full points for fork that can introduce a compassionate zombie angle.
